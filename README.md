# Stock-Analysis Challenge
## Overview of Project
This project was designed to help Steve as a beginning investment advisor.  His parents had asked him about a specific stock, and he had expanded his search to include several other companies.  I used VBA to analyse the stock data that Steve had collected to determine which companies had improved in their stock values over the course of two years, 2017 and 2018.
## Results
The results showed that in 2017, all of the stocks improved except for TERP.  However, in 2018, all of the stocks had negative returns for the year excapt for ENPH and RUN.  
Steve also requested that we run the code in such a way that the program can run quickly and efficiently. The first version of the code ran in 0.64 seconds.  ![Original Code Time]([Original Code Time.png](https://github.com/machudpicchu/Stock-Analysis/blob/main/Original%20Code%20Time.png))
